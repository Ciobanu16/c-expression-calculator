A complete arithmetic expression interpreter written in C, implementing the classical infix-to-postfix (Shunting Yard) algorithm and a stack-driven postfix evaluator. The project demonstrates knowledge of parsing techniques, data structures (stacks), operator precedence, and secure numerical evaluation.
